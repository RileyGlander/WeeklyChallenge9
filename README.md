# WeeklyChallenge9

## Description
- What was your motivation? What motivated me was trying to build a tool that could build a README.md file for those who struggle to build one on their own. This is a tool that could really help me save time in the future, so building something that I could use in the future really motivated me.
- Why did you build this project? This was a great way to work with node and to create a tool that anyone can use especially for those wo are tired of trying to make their own README.md file each time.
- What problem does it solve? It solves the problem of trying to come up with questions to include in the README.md file with an easy and quick method.
- What did you learn? During this challenge I was able to learn and understand node and how it works. An example would be getting the 'require()' method to work.

## Installation
You can install this with git bash by typing in 'git clone *Replace this with link*' to wherever you want the repository to be installed on your computer.

## Usage
You can use this by getting the repository downloaded with the instructions above. You can then open it with Visual Studio Code. From there you want to right click on index.js and open in integrated terminal. Once you do that, type 'node index.js' into the terminal. There will be questions that appear where you can then type in your answer for each one. It will then update the GeneratedREADME.md with the questions and reponses.
